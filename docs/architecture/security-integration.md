# Security Integration

### Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** JWT + Passport with Google OAuth integration
- Secure token-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party authentication
- Session management through secure HTTP-only cookies
- Password hashing with bcryptjs

**Authorization:** Role-based access control system
- User roles and permissions managed through NestJS guards
- API endpoint protection with JWT validation
- Admin dashboard access control through existing authorization
- Resource-level permissions for posts, comments, and admin functions

**Data Protection:** Comprehensive data security measures
- Input validation and sanitization through class-validator
- SQL injection protection via TypeORM parameterized queries
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection implemented in backend

**Security Tools:** Industry-standard security implementations
- Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation at API layer
- Secure password policies

### Enhancement Security Requirements
**New Security Measures:** UI-focused security enhancements only
- Enhanced client-side input validation for better UX (server validation remains primary)
- Improved error message handling to prevent information disclosure
- Theme preference storage security (if using local storage, implement proper sanitization)

**Integration Points:** Seamless security integration
- All enhanced forms maintain existing validation patterns
- Authentication UI improvements preserve existing security flows
- Admin dashboard enhancements respect existing authorization checks
- No new client-side security dependencies required

**Compliance Requirements:** Maintain existing security standards
- OWASP compliance maintained through existing backend security measures
- GDPR compliance preserved through existing data handling practices
- No additional compliance requirements for UI-only changes

### Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** Leverage current security testing approach
- Authentication flow testing maintained
- Authorization boundary testing preserved
- Input validation testing continues

**New Security Test Requirements:** UI-specific security validation
- Enhanced form validation testing (client + server)
- Theme preference storage security testing
- XSS protection verification for any new user input fields
- CSRF token handling in enhanced forms

**Penetration Testing:** No additional penetration testing required
- UI changes don't introduce new attack vectors
- Existing security testing covers enhanced components
- Focus on ensuring enhanced components don't bypass existing security measures
